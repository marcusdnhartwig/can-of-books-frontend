<!-- (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission) -->
 
## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
 
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
 
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
 
## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
 
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Process
#### Logistical:
 
* What hours will you be available to communicate?
1pm - 10pm 
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
 - We will use Slack : Remo : Zoom :
 
* How often will you take breaks?
 - Mas o menos every hourish
 
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
 - Lean into TA's
 
 
#### Cooperative:
* Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
 - Marcus: Clear communicator, hardy (able to work long hrs), Knows when he doesn't know, approachable,
 - Christopher’s strengths are writing and Google Fu.
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
 - Marcus: is able to lean into these by way of engaging w/ ta's as well as chris in order to complete the assignment.
 - Christopher can utilize his strengths by taking lead when content needs to be written, and by taking the initiative to google for answers when we’re confused by something and waiting on TA help.
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
 - Marcus: I want to grow in technical language skills.
 - Christopher wants to develop greater strength in building back-end.
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
 - We plan on working via pair programming. We can take turns being Driver and Navigator, and also utilize LiveShare extension of VSCode so we can both be editing either front-end or back-end at the same time and talking it out with one another as we do it.
 
#### Conflict Resolution:
* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
If one person is pulling all the weight, we know we have a safe space of communication between the two of us for either person to bring that up and to discuss how to divy up our tasks better.
 
 * What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Again, we will bring it up to each other and not move forward at all until we’ve figured out how to equitably divy up tasks again.
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
 
We will not be afraid to ask questions (no such thing as a dumb question) and remind ourselves that we both have our unique strengths and we are also both new to this, so it’s okay to be figuring this out as we go along and actually really cool if we can learn from each other.
